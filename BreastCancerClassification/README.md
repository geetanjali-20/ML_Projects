**Breast Cancer** is a most common disease in women now-a-days. It is the major cause of death among women .  As we known as early as one came to know about ones disease then its curable. Breast cancer is mainly common among the women of age group 30-40. As, Our Science and Technology has been so advance now , itâ€™s very easy to detect the cancer by a machine too, its require some algorithms. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a common method of detection of cancer now a days as its time efficient and gives result with high accuracy.  so In this paper we have just compared some of the best algorithms on the Histopathological dataset named as BreaKHis dataset. The algorithms I have used are ***Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine( SVM),Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier.***

- According to a data of 2019 there are about 18 million new cases come annually and about 8.8 million people lose their life just because of cancer.
- As of a report of WHO, by 2025 the number of women having breast cancer may reach to a number of 19.3million.

In the last few years, various data mining and machine learning techniques have been developed for breast cancer detection and classification, there are three main stages for the breast cancer classification :-1) Pre-processing 2) Feature extraction, and 3)Classification.

### *Deep Neural Network (DNN)* is used as a classifier and *BreakHis Dataset* from UCI repository is used Dataset for this.
