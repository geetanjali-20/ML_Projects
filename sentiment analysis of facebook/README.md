In past few years a lot of research has been done in the field of sentiment analysis. Various approaches shown in like _Lexicon-Based approach , Machine Learning approach, Hybrid approach_(combination of Lexicon-Based approach and Machine Learning approach, Deep Learning Approach and Data Mining Techniques were applied. Out of all approaches Machine learning approach is mostly used approach, it is a supervised learning method requires trained data in order to be processed, hence it is time consuming process. Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are two most used method in Machine Learning approach. On the other hand, Lexicon-Based approach is unsupervised learning method. It depends upon the dictionary.
